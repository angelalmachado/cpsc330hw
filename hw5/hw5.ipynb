    "In this homework you will be working on an open-ended mini-project, where you will put all the different things you have learned so far together to solve an interesting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes and tips when you work on this mini-project: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips\n",
    "1. This mini-project is open-ended, and while working on it, there might be some situations where you'll have to use your own judgment and make your own decisions (as you would be doing when you work as a data scientist). Make sure you explain your decisions whenever necessary. \n",
    "2. **Do not include everything you ever tried in your submission** -- it's fine just to have your final code. That said, your code should be reproducible and well-documented. For example, if you chose your hyperparameters based on some hyperparameter optimization experiment, you should leave in the code for that experiment so that someone else could re-run it and obtain the same hyperparameters, rather than mysteriously just setting the hyperparameters to some (carefully chosen) values in your code. \n",
    "3. If you realize that you are repeating a lot of code try to organize it in functions. Clear presentation of your code, experiments, and results is the key to be successful in this lab. You may use code from lecture notes or previous lab solutions with appropriate attributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assessment\n",
    "We plan to grade fairly and leniently. We don't have some secret target score that you need to achieve to get a good grade. **You'll be assessed on demonstration of mastery of course topics, clear presentation, and the quality of your analysis and results.** For example, if you just have a bunch of code and no text or figures, that's not good. If you do a bunch of sane things and get a lower accuracy than your friend, don't sweat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A final note\n",
    "Finally, this style of this \"project\" question is different from other assignments. It'll be up to you to decide when you're \"done\" -- in fact, this is one of the hardest parts of real projects. But please don't spend WAY too much time on this... perhaps \"a few hours\" (15-20 hours???) is a good guideline for this project . Of course if you're having fun you're welcome to spend as much time as you want! But, if so, try not to do it out of perfectionism or getting the best possible grade. Do it because you're learning and enjoying it. Students from the past cohorts have found such kind of labs useful and fun and we hope you enjoy it as well. "

    "In this assignment we'll be exploring a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) of New York City Airbnb listings from 2019. As usual, you'll need to start by downloading the dataset. In this assignment we'll try to predict `reviews_per_month`, as a proxy for the popularity of the listing. Airbnb could use this sort of model to predict how popular future listings might be before they are posted, perhaps to help guide hosts create more appealing listings. In reality they might instead use something like vacancy rate or average rating as their target, but we do not have that available here.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note there is an updated version of this dataset with more features available [here](http://insideairbnb.com/). The features were are using in `listings.csv.gz` for the New York city datasets. You will also see some other files like `reviews.csv.gz`. For your own interest you may want to explore the expanded dataset and try your analysis there. However, please submit your results on the dataset obtained from Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Spend some time understanding the problem and what each feature means. You can find this information in the documentation on. You can find an explaination of the features [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iWCNJcSutYqpULSQHlNyGInUvHg2BoUGoNRIGa6Szc4/edit).  Write a few sentences on your initial thoughts on the problem and the dataset. \n",

    "**Overall observations about the data**: The exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted on this dataset provides valuable insights that will be instrumental in building a predictive model for reviews per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Data Size_: The large dataset size (34,226 examples) provides a substantial amount of data for training and testing a predictive model. This ample data can help ensure that the model is robust and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Skewed Distribution_ : The observation that the data is right-skewed suggests that there are outliers significantly impacting the average. This is a critical finding because it indicates the presence of high-performing listings that receive an unusually high number of reviews per month. Understanding and handling these outliers will be crucial in model development.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Unique Values_: The presence of 887 unique values for reviews per month indicates the diversity of the dataset. This diversity in the target variable is important for modeling as it suggests that the prediction task is not simply classifying listings into a few predefined categories. Instead, it calls for a regression or forecasting approach to predict a continuous range of review counts. This makes it suitable for regression-based predictive modeling methods and highlights the need for techniques capable of handling a wide range of possible review counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Distribution Visualization_: The histogram visually confirms the skewed distribution, reinforcing the need to address outliers appropriately in the model-building process. It also underscores that most listings receive a lower number of reviews per month, which will likely be a focal point for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Correlation Analysis_: The correlations between reviews per month and other attributes such as price and minimum stay duration provide valuable insights. For example, lower prices and shorter stays are associated with higher numbers of reviews per month. These insights can inform feature selection and engineering, helping to build a more accurate predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the EDA not only highlights the characteristics of the reviews per month variable but also identifies potential predictors that may be useful in the model. It will help guide the data preprocessing steps, such as handling outliers, and helps in selecting relevant features for the predictive model as well as understanding the feature importances of the models we will build.
