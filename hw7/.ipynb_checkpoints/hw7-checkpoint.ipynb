    "1. The embeddings reflect worrisome cultural, gender, and age stereotypes. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Comparing the similarity of “chinese” and “intelligent” (0.28059465) to “aboriginal” and “intelligent” (0.18364623), the similarity of “chinese” to “intelligent” is about 0.1 higher than that of “aboriginal”. This indicates that there is a bias that Chinese are more intelligent than Aboriginal people, which is a negative cultural stereotype. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Comparing the similarity of “man” and “construction” (0.29262656) to “woman” and “construction” (0.23188335), the similarity of “man” to “construction is about 0.06 higher than that of “woman”. This indicates that there is a bias that man are more into construction than woman, which is a negative gender stereotype.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Another gender stereotype is reflected when “shout” is similar to “man” in the same sense as “cry” is similar to “woman”. This indicates that there is a gender bias that when men and women get emotional, men tend to shout while women tend to cry, which is not the actual case at all since men can cry as well. Furthermore, “cry” was not on the list of analogy words for “man”, which extends the gender bias that men do not “cry”.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    An age stereotype is reflected when “weak” is similar to “elderly” in the same sense as “strong” is similar to “youth”. This indicates that there is an age bias since the data assumed that while youths are strong, elderly are going to be weak. This is an untrue stereotype as elderly can be strong as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Embeddings with biases can cause harm in the real world as they may amplify the stereotypes because of their widespread usage in the society. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Take for example a construction job market where the recruiters use the word embeddings trained on the Wikipedia data. As we have seen previously, the embeddings display gender biases by associating construction to men more as compared to women. As the recruiters rely on the biased embedding, they might prioritize applications sent in by men and hire more men in the construction industry. This will further exacerbate the stereotype of more men being in the construction industry and reduce the association between women and construction. This also leads to more discrimination against women in construction. Hence it is important to de-bias the embeddings, such as leaving a note of potential stereotypes in the data, so as to mitigate the effects of spreading the stereotypes."

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Preprocessing using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)\n",
    "rubric={points}\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing is a crucial step before carrying out topic modeling and it markedly affects topic modeling results. In this exercise, you'll prepare the data using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) for topic modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Write code using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) to preprocess the `text` column in the given dataframe `df` and save the processed text in a new column called `text_pp` within the same dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not have spaCy in your course environment, you'll have to [install it](https://spacy.io/usage) and download the pretrained model en_core_web_md. \n",
    "\n",
    "`python -m spacy download en_core_web_md`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is no such thing as \"perfect\" preprocessing. You'll have to make your own judgments and decisions on which tokens are likely to be more informative for the given task. Some common text preprocessing steps for topic modeling include: \n",
    "- getting rid of slashes, new-line characters, or any other non-informative characters\n",
    "- sentence segmentation and tokenization      \n",
    "- replacing urls, email addresses, or numbers with generic tokens such as \"URL\",  \"EMAIL\", \"NUM\". \n",
    "- getting rid of other fairly unique tokens which are not going to help us in topic modeling  \n",
    "- excluding stopwords and punctuation \n",
    "- lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Check out [these available attributes](https://spacy.io/api/token#attributes) for `token` in spaCy which might help you with preprocessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "> You can also get rid of words with specific POS tags. [Here](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/) is the list of part-of-speech tags used in spaCy. \n",
    "\n",
    "> You may have to use regex to clean text before passing it to spaCy. Also, you might have to go back and forth between preprocessing in this exercise and and topic modeling in Exercise 2 before finalizing preprocessing steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that preprocessing the corpus might take some time. So here are a couple of suggestions: 1) During the debugging phase, work on a smaller subset of the data. 2) Once you finalize the preprocessing part, you might want to save the preprocessed data in a CSV and work with this CSV so that you don't run the preprocessing part every time you run the notebook. \n",

    "1. Content-based filtering in recommender systems builds user profiles for each user based on their reactions (such as ratings) to items and combines that with the known features of the item. These user profiles are then used to recommend new items. For example, let's consider a book recommender system. Let's suppose we have information about Jane Doe and her ratings for books X, Y, and Z and we have information about the genre of the books: X is a crime thriller, Y is a sci-fi and Z is fantasy. If Jane Doe has a higher rating for X and Y and a lower rating for Z, content-based filtering will infer that she likes crime thrillers and sci-fi but dislikes fantasy books and thus builds a user profile. Based on the user profile, it will recommend books she likes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Two negative consequences of recommender systems are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Recommender systems encourage a potential for bias in users**. Since recommender systems are based on the users' likes, the suggestions will feed into a user's opinions and limit the information they consume. While this might not be crucial in products or movies, it is crucial in recommender systems of news, articles, research papers, and videos. For example, a personalized online news recommendation system might use a user's news article history to infer their political views, and recommend articles that mostly favor their views. This limits the knowledge they have and creates a bias, strengthened by the limit information they consume.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Recommender systems are widely used in many applications and the type of data collected by these systems differs based on their application, some more sensitive than others**. This brings a privacy concern. The collected data can indicate a user's preferences, consumption behaviors, social information, and more which can also be used to infer other sensitive information such as income, if they have children or if they have a partner, etc. Despite certain privacy laws, there is always a risk of this information leaking or being sold to a third-party or improperly used.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Transfer Learning is the practice of using pre-trained models and fine-tuning them specific to the problem at hand. This is commonly used in natural language processing and computer vision to increase efficiency compared to training from scratch as the latter would require a large dataset and can be expensive computationally and cost-wise.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Comments on how each model might be handling multiclass classification (*adapted from scikit-learn documentation*):\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Decision Tree can naturally handle multi-class classification by default. The training will be similar to that of a binary classification except for the fact that now, Y_train has multiple classes instead of just two. When predicting, the model compares each class' probability for a given example and picks the one with the highest probability or the lowest index if there are multiple classes with equal highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. KNN can also naturally handle multi-class classification by default. The training and prediction is the same as if it were a binary classification. When predicting, the model will calculate the given example's distance with other examples and pick the K nearest neighbors. The class label that makes up a majority of these K nearest neighbors will be predicted as the label for the example in question.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Random Forest is made up of individual decision trees and therefore, can handle multi-class classification by default. As a whole, the training and predicting will be similar to a binary classification while individual decision trees' predictions will occur in the same way as mentioned above.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. Logistic Regression can handle multi-class classification, only when the parameter 'multi_class' is set to 'ovr' or 'multinomial'. When set to 'ovr', Logistic Regression learns a binary classifier model for each class and when predicting, it compares the raw scores of each binary model and picks the one with the highest score.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5. SVM RBF can handle multi-class classification using the one vs one approach. For n classes, it constructs (n * (n - 1))/2 binary classifiers. While internally SVM RBF uses the one vs one approach, it is possible to transform these results to a one vs rest matrix by setting the 'decision_function_shape' to 'ovr'. In this case, the model would construct the ovr matrix from the ovo matrix that it built internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Transfer learning involves utilizing pre-trained models and they can be used as feature transformers. The property of multiple sequential transformations is useful because it enables us to apply pre-trained models as well as our own feature transformations and feature engineering to the data before prediction. This adapts pre-trained models and fine-tunes them specific to our needs."
